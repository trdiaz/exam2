CS 1290 Problem Solving

## Description:
Solve 5 of the following problems using dynamic programming (you must use dynamic programming to earn points. Other solutions will not be accepted).

For each problem, you must do the following:
Define the problem/solution recursively (this is the most important step – if you don’t do this correctly, you will automatically get a 0 for the problem regardless of the code you write).
Briefly talk about how you plan to store solutions to sub-problems and combining them to solve the global problem (talk about the data structure/variables you’ll use to solve the problem).
Talk about how you used IDEAL and Duke 7 to tackle the problem
Code your solution.
