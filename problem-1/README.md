# Problem 1: Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings
Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.
Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.

## Step-1: Defining the problem and solution recursively
A recursive approach to this problem is to find 

## Step-2: Utilization of sub-problems to solve a global problem


## Step-3: IDEAL and Duke 7 implmentation
