# Problem 1: Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings
Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

## Step-1: Defining the problem and solution recursively
A recursive approach to this problem is to find 

## Step-2: Utilization of sub-problems to solve a global problem


## Step-3: IDEAL and Duke 7 implmentation
