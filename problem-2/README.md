# Problem 2: Minimum falling path sum
Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.


## Step-1: Defining the problem and solution recursively


## Step-2: Utilization of sub-problems to solve a global problem


## Step-3: IDEAL and Duke 7 implementation
